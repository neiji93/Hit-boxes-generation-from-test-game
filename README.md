# Hit-boxes-generation-from-test-game
Currently, this is just an esquisse but we will use maximum entropy models with NNs to develop a fighting game which rely on attacks to improve game experiences. So, if the raw datas of the hitboxes are suitable for some loss functions in model columns, we can work directly without trouble. Can't wait to share our work.
